# SageMaker-IT-Domain-Expert

Technologies Used:

1-Amazon SageMaker: The project utilizes Amazon SageMaker, a fully managed service that provides every developer and data scientist with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning models quickly.

2-Meta Llama 2 7B Model: The Meta Llama 2 7B foundation model serves as the base for fine-tuning. This model has been pre-trained for text-generation tasks and will be adapted to the IT domain through fine-tuning.

3-Python: Python programming language is extensively used for scripting and interacting with AWS services, including SageMaker.

4-AWS Services: The project leverages various AWS services, including IAM (Identity and Access Management) for managing access to AWS services securely, EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) for requesting GPU instances for model training, and S3 (Simple Storage Service) for storing datasets and model artifacts.
