# SageMaker-IT-Domain-Expert

## Context of the project
This repository hosts a proof-of-concept (POC) project titled "Introducing Generative AI with AWS", focusing on fine-tuning large language models using SageMaker. The project aims to equip students with advanced ML and LLM skills by developing a domain expert model tailored for a specific domain. Leveraging AWS tools, students train a language model capable of generating contextually relevant text responses. The project emphasizes rigorous evaluation, comparing the fine-tuned model against the original to validate effectiveness, serving as a resource for high-quality ML solutions.

## About the project 
This project aimed at developing a domain expert model tailored for the Information Technology (IT) domain. The project employs advanced NLP techniques to train and deploy in AWS SageMaker a large language model, capable of generating informative and contextually relevant text responses in the IT domain.

## Dataset Used:
The dataset selected for this project revolves around challenges in ubiquitous data management within the IT domain. It contains discussions on various aspects such as mobility support, context awareness, support for collaboration, adaptivity, and user interaction within ubiquitous computing environments. This dataset serves as the training ground for fine-tuning the language model to become a domain expert in IT-related text generation.


## Steps Used in the Project:

1- Dataset Selection: A dataset relevant to the IT domain is selected. The chosen dataset contains unstructured text discussing challenges and requirements in ubiquitous data management within the IT domain.

2- Environment Configuration:

  -An AWS SageMaker IAM Role is configured to provide necessary permissions for accessing AWS resources.
  -An AWS SageMaker Notebook Instance is set up for developing and running code.
  -A GPU instance (ml.g5.2xlarge) is requested for fine-tuning the language model.

3- Fine-tuning the Language Model:

-The Meta Llama 2 7B foundation model is deployed on the AWS platform.
-Python scripts are employed to fine-tune the model on the selected IT domain dataset, enhancing its understanding of domain-specific language and concepts.

4- Model Deployment:

  -The fine-tuned language model is deployed on SageMaker to make it accessible for inference.
  
5- Testing and Evaluation:

  -The deployed model is tested and evaluated for its responses to domain-specific knowledge and text-generation tasks relevant to the IT domain. As part of the project evaluation, I conducted a comparative analysis between the fine-tuned model and the deployed model to discern any differences in their performance. This comparative assessment aimed to gauge the effectiveness of fine-tuning the language model on domain-specific data.


## Technologies Used:

1-Amazon SageMaker: The project utilizes Amazon SageMaker, a fully managed service that provides every developer and data scientist with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning models quickly.

2-Meta Llama 2 7B Model: The Meta Llama 2 7B foundation model serves as the base for fine-tuning. This model has been pre-trained for text-generation tasks and will be adapted to the IT domain through fine-tuning.

3-Python: Python programming language is extensively used for scripting and interacting with AWS services, including SageMaker.

4-AWS Services: The project leverages various AWS services, including IAM (Identity and Access Management) for managing access to AWS services securely, EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) for requesting GPU instances for model training, and S3 (Simple Storage Service) for storing datasets and model artifacts.


## Comparative Analysis:
The project includes a comparative analysis between the fine-tuned and deployed models to assess performance, validating the effectiveness of fine-tuning on domain-specific data.


## Documentation and Submission:
A comprehensive report documenting the process, challenges, and solutions is prepared for submission.
